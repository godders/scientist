A 4x12 ergonomic columnar stagger keyboard PCB for tray mount 60% cases.

The design is heavily influenced by fantastic projects like Lumberjack, Discipline, Cornelius, Rebound and Reviung, incorporating many of the ideas in one place. I've been refining the design and layout for a long time and have now been using various prototypes as my primary keyboard for several months, it's now at the point where it feels like a viable product rather than a prototype of a slightly crazy idea.

Features

 * Ergonomic columnar stagger layout
 * Support for many (most?) 60% tray mount cases
 * Aggressive pinky stagger
 * Hotswap PCB
 * Mostly through-hole construction for easy DIY construction (see below)
 * Optional RGB Underglow
 * Optional support for up to 3 encoders
 * Optional support for OLED or encoder in the central position

Kit includes

 * PCB
 * Plate
 * 50x Hotswap sockets
 * Acrylic cover and mounting hardware
 * An ATMega32A flashed with a USB bootloader
 * Components necessary to complete the build

Optional

 * 16x underglow LEDs
 * 128x32 OLED
 * Encoders
 * Knobs

Case support

The PCB should supports most 60% cases with Poker style tray mount points. It's been tested with Tofu60, Mekanisk's Klippe T and Fjell cases and various generic 60% cases. It does *not* support cases with very thick (<4mm) mounting posts in the two central mount point locations and may require kapton tape insulation for some cases with <3mm mounting posts. Does not support BBox60 cases without modification due to the many extra mount points present.
